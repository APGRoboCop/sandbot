About
=====
A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. See http://www.teamsandpit.com/#sandbot for what it is currently playable with.

If you want to build from the source then you should build one of the tagged releases - the top of master isn't always tested or working.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whom this probably wouldn't be happening.

Building
========
Windows
-------
Open Sandbot-2008.sln in Visual Studio (it was made using Visual Studio 2008 but newer versions should probably open it fine).
A Visual Studio 2015 solution is also provided (Sandbot-2015.sln) but currently isn't used for active development.

Linux
-----
Run make.
