About
=====
A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. See http://www.teamsandpit.com/#sandbot for what it currently is playable with.

If you want to build from the source build one of the tagged releases - the top of master generally isn't very stable.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whom this probably wouldn't be happening.

Building
========
Windows
-------
Open HPB_bot-2008.sln in Visual Studio (it was made using Visual Studio 2008 but newer versions should probably open it fine).
Visual Studio 6, Borland and mingw projects all exist in the repo but these are unsupported and will probably be removed.

Linux
-----
Run make. Makefile is the Linux makefile.
