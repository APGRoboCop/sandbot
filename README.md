A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. See http://www.teamsandpit.com/#sandbot for what it currently is playable with.

If you want to build from the source build one of the tagged releases - the top of master generally isn't very stable.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whom this probably wouldn't be happening.
