About
=====
A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. See http://www.teamsandpit.com/#sandbot for what it is currently playable with.

If you want to build from the source then you should build one of the tagged releases - the top of master isn't always tested or working.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whom this probably wouldn't be happening.

Building
========
Windows
-------
Open Sandbot-2017.sln in Visual Studio 2017. You can probably load it in older (or newer) versions too.

Linux
-----
Run make.
