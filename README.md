A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. Note that support for each mod varies and only are complete and many aren't even playable.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whom this probably wouldn't be happening.
