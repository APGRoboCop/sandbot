About
=====
A bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, They Hunger and The Ship. See http://www.teamsandpit.com/#sandbot for what it is currently playable with.

Based heavily on HPB Bot written by Jeffrey "botman" Broome, without whose framework and code this probably wouldn't be happening.

Playing
=======
Use one of the tagged releases if you want to play. The head of master is generally unstable.
