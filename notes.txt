git tag -a v0.x -m "Sandbot v0.x"

Change gamedll to addons/metamod/dlls/metamod.dll to test MetaMod. sandbot.dll should go in the same directory (but change the path in plugins.ini so it points to the top level dlls/ directory).

scripts/windows_exports.bat and scripts/linux_exports.sh generate formatted exports that can be copy+pasted into linkfuncs.cpp - you may need to change the paths to some things.

Copy dlls/Release/vc141.pdb and dlls/Release/sandbot.pdb to symbols/
