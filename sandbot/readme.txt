== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. Can you add MetaMod support?
A. I've tried and things just broke unexpectedly, so not right now.

Q. Can it be used for dedicated servers?
A. Maybe - I haven't tested it, but it should.

Q. Can I make some waypoints?
A. Yes, but hold off for now - things are probably going to change in that space.
